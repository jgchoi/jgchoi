1. What does a Java compiler do?
	Convert plain text to bytecodes for JVM.
2. Assuming that the Java program does not have any syntax errors.
   What does the compiler produce if the user has entered the following
   command:HelloWorld.class

   >javac HelloWorld.java

3. What does a Java Virtual Machine do?
	Runs the .class files inside of virtual machine.
4. Do different operating system platforms (e.g. Windows, Linux, Mac)
   use identical Java Virtual Machines? Please explain briefly.
  
  Yes. Oracle created different JVM that support different platforms. Even though, JVM is different from each
  other, the way it works (how to interpret the .class file) is same.
  
  
5. I have created a Java program (e.g. HelloWorld.java) on a Windows
   machine. What must I do if I want to run this Java program on a Linux
   machine?
   
   Install JVM on the Linux.
