1. Quadratic Complexity
	- Is this refering to two for loops?
	- I don't think there is any new concept about problem solving.

2. Smart Pointer to move an object
	- It handles throw by itself.
	- It takes care of constructing and destructing of pointer
	- For the raw pointer, I thought push back moves the pointer but I realized that it copy the value in object.
	- (Maybe if I use move in += operator for raw pointer, I don't need to delete the temp pointer?)
	- Wheareas smart pointer(unique) uses move.
	- In some sense, smart pointer works as raw pointer, but requires some knowledge about template and data type.

3. Overall
	- Easy lab
	- Still confused about reference, dereference and pointer stuff.
