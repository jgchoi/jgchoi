I tried to fix the error, but DB (I even tried copy from Ravideep's AppData folder), does not changes after code-first migration trial.

It gives exception for methods that uses updated version of model.

I was waiting for your notice until the 8:00 pm of Nov. 23, but did not want to not submit the work.
